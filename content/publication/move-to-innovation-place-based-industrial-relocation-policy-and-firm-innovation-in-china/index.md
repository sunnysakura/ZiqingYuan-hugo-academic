  Purpose –This study investigates whether and how place-based industrial
  relocation policy affects firm innovation.


  Design/methodology/approach – By exploiting the establishment of China's National Industrial Relocation Demonstration Zones (NIRDZs) as a quasi-natural experiment in a difference-in-differences design, we examine the externalities of industrial policies that support sustainable development and growth from the perspectives of firms' patenting activities.


  Findings – The study consistently finds that the NIRDZs policy significantly boosts local firm innovation, translating into a 60.46 percent increase in the patent applications of treated firms. The estimation results remain robust to a series of alternative specifications. Moreover, heterogeneity analysis suggests that the firms that benefited most were state-owned enterprises, firms with higher productivity, or firms in non-high-tech industries. Further, we find that the NIRDZs policy stimulates firm innovation mainly in the form of utility model patents, followed by designs and invention patents.


  Research limitations/implications –our results provide suggestions and implications for policymakers to improve the efficiency of state-led industrial policies and avoid "government failure" in policy implementation. 


  Originality/value –(i) This study fills the research gap by exploiting quasi-experiments to assess the effectiveness of state-led industrial policies for emerging economies. (ii) Our analysis sheds empirical light on how corporate innovation is motivated and financed by selective and functional industrial policies. (iii) Theoretically, our results rationalize why state-led industrial relocation fuel innovation capabilities of localities from Marshall externalities and competition crowding-out effects.
