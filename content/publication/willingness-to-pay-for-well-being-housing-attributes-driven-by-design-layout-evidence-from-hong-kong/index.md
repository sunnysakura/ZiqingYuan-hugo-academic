abstract: Housing design layout plays a crucial role in occupant well-being, yet
  existing research has not clearly understood occupantsâ€™ preferences for
  different housing design layout attributes. This study aims to elucidate
  preferences by measuring demand-side willingness to pay (WTP) for housing
  attributes related to well-being and influenced by design layout. We first
  simulate the metrics of five housing attributes under different layouts, i.e.,
  spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), spatial glare autonomy (sGA), natural
  ventilation effectiveness (NVE), predicted mean vote (PMV), and energy use
  intensity (EUI). Then, WTP for these attributes is disentangled from housing
  prices using the hedonic model. The findings demonstrate that a 1 % increase
  in sDA, sGA, and NVE corresponds to respective increases of 1.342 %, 0.694 %,
  and 2.842 % in housing prices, showing that residents value greatly the
  presence of natural ventilation and well-lit spaces with appropriate daylight.
  However, no significant correlations are found for PMV and EUI, suggesting a
  lack of a general preference towards thermal comfort or energy consumption in
  the Hong Kong context. This study contributes to a deeper knowledge of key
  well-being attributes in housing design as well as practical insights to
  create housing environments that prioritise occupant well-being and enhance
  market value. Future research should consider expanding to diverse housing
  markets, incorporating more well-being attributes, and examining the temporal
  variations of WTP.
