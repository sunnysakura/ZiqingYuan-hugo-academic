abstract: This study investigates the causal relationship between homeownership
  and subjective well-being based on household-level panel data collected from
  the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) in 2011 and 2013. The extent to
  which homeownership contributes to the changes in subjective well-being is
  estimated, focusing on the heterogeneous effects across socioeconomic and
  demographic groups. Evidence from the identification strategies indicates that
  homeownership has a positive impact on subjective well-being. Moreover, the
  results are robust to different specifications and unaffected by the financial
  constraints faced by new homeowners. Our findings have useful implications for
  policymakers to stimulate homeownership rates to promote subjective
  well-being.

summary: We investigated the causal effect of homeownership on subjective
  well-being. The causal relationship was estimated using the
  difference-in-differences approach. Tenure change from renter to owner
  significantly increased subjective well-being. The causal effect was
  unaffected by the financial burdens of new homeowners.
