abstract: This paper studies the impact of tariff cuts on workers’ wages in a
  single labor market by examining the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement
  (CEPA) trade liberalization, in which China unilaterally eliminated hundreds
  of tariffs on Hong Kong’s goods in 2004. Utilizing five Hong Kong censuses
  from 1996 to 2016, we find consistent result that a one-sided tariff
  concession leads to an increase in the monthly wage of affected workers,
  averaging between 5.75% and 6.84%. Moreover, we explore the possibility that
  the effects of exposure to CEPA may be heterogeneous along several dimensions.
  The workers who benefited the most were more educated, in higher-skilled
  occupations, Mandarin-speaking, near retirement, or just starting their
  careers. Surprisingly, we found no increase in employment in the treated
  industries. We conclude that tariff cuts’ wage impact and, hence, their impact
  on wage inequality, depend on the local labor market composition and
  structure.

summary: We study the impact of one-sided tariff cuts on wages of workers in
  Hong Kong. Tariff concession leads to an increase in the wage of affected
  workers. More educated and higher-skilled workers benefit more from the tariff
  cuts. Impact of tariff cuts on wage inequality depends on the labor market
  structure.
