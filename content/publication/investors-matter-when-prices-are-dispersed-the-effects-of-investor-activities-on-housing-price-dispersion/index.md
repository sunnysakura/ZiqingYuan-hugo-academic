  Housing price dispersion highlights the individual differences in capital
  gains by capturing the

  varying prices among comparable properties. We examine the impact of investors’ activities

  on housing price dispersion within the Hong Kong private housing market, based on micro-

  level transactions. Our results indicate that investors’ activities can significantly lower price

  dispersion in housing markets, even after accounting for trading volumes. The reduction

  effect of investment activities on price dispersion varies across boom-bust cycles, being more

  pronounced in cooler markets. We address the roles of housing investors in facilitating the

  price discovery process and reducing price dispersion by providing liquidity and mitigating

  information asymmetry. This suggests that well-informed investors can play a welfare-

  enhancing role by improving information efficiency. We also demonstrate that nearby

  investment activities can indirectly influence local price dispersion through information

  spillover effects. Our findings have profound implications for facilitating information efficiency

  and the potential for reducing price dispersion.
