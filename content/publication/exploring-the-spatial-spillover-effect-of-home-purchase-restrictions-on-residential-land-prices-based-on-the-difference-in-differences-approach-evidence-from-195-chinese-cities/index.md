abstract: Since 2008, the sustained and rapid escalation of housing prices has
  increasingly become an alarming issue in most Chinese cities, to which the
  government has responded by strengthening its macro-control of the housing
  marking. The home purchase restrictions (HPR) policy is considered the
  harshest regulation implemented to cool down the housing market by eliminating
  housing speculation. This paper investigates the spatial externality of HPR on
  residential land prices in surrounding unregulated cities from a
  spatiotemporal perspective. The HPR policy tends to relocate
  regulation-induced housing demand to neighboring cities without restrictions
  in place, thereby leading to a rise in residential land demand and prices via
  inter-city housing purchases. Using the difference-in-differences approach, we
  reveal that adopting the HPR policy leads to a 10.3 % significant increase in
  land prices for neighboring cities without purchase restrictions based on
  parcel-level land transactions in 195 Chinese cities. The causal effects are
  robust across different specifications. Moreover, spillovers of the HPR policy
  vary with different land uses and sources. The spatial heterogeneity arises
  from the structural changes in residential land demand in response to the HPR
  policy. Finally, this paper emphasizes that policymakers should consider the
  spatial heterogeneity, dynamic linkages between cities, and the supply side
  when establishing housing regulations and developing land-use plans.
