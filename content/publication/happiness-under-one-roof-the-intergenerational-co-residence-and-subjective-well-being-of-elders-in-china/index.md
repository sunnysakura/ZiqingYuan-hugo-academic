abstract: This study investigates the relationship between intergenerational
  co-residence and the subjective well-being (SWB) of elders based on the
  individual-level panel data collected from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy
  Longevity Survey from 2002 to 2014. We use the endogenous treatment effect
  model to minimize selection bias and estimate the causal impacts of
  intergenerational co-residence on parental SWB. In addition, we employ the
  individual fixed-effect model for robustness checks. Results corroborate that
  elders who live with their adult–children are happier than those who do not
  undergo such a living arrangement. We also investigate heterogeneous effects
  across geographical regions and demographic groups. Older people in rural
  areas who co-reside with their adult–children gain a more substantial
  co-residence effect compared with those in urban areas. Moreover, results are
  robust according to different specifications. Our findings provide useful
  implications for policymakers in promoting the SWB of elders.
