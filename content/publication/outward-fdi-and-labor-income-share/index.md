abstract: "the Belt and Road Initiative”provides new perspectives and
  opportunities for outward foreign direct investments
  (OFDI，OutwardForeignDirectInvestment) for China’s companies，which is gaining
  massive expansion recently. From the micro - enterprise
  perspective，enterprises that undertake OFDI may have strength in optimizing
  the allocation of resources and solving the problem of excess capacity through
  transferring production，thereby giving impetus to industrial transformation
  and upgrading. In this case，OFDI may lead to a reduction in domestic
  employment and a fall in the labor income share，which has the potential to
  threaten industrial development and individual wellbeing. On the other
  hand，enterprises may involve the mechanisms by which firms can not only make
  use of complementary advantages，but also have access to new resources，new
  technologies and promote their productivity and increase company strength
  through learning effects or inverse technology spillover effects. In the
  circumstances，OFDI may be beneficial for employees on the other side.
  Therefore，the relationship between OFDI and domestic firm - level labor income
  share is mixed and ambiguous. Based on the China’s listed company in stock
  market from 2003 -2016，this paper analyzes the causal relationship between
  OFDI alongside“the Belt and Road”and domestic firm - level labor income share
  using propensity score matching and difference - in - differences methods. We
  estimated the extent to which OFDI contributes to the changes in domestic firm
  - level labor income share，focusing on the heterogeneous effects across
  companies，industries and employees. The results show that OFDI significantly
  increases domestic labor share and has a positive effect in the long run.
  Furthermore， distinguishing the heterogeneity of companies and employees，the
  empirical results remain the same in general. The positive effects are more
  pronounced for private firms without state ownership，firms with higher
  productivity and firms located in eastern developed regions or western
  industrial area. And such gains are also higher for firms in technology -
  intensive industries or hyper - competitive industries. Additionally，the
  results estimated by generalized quantile regression show that skill - biased
  technological change exists in domestic companies. The OFDI has positive
  impact on domestic labor share of skilled employees and no significant effect
  on unskilled employees. Moreover，we shed light on the mechanisms through which
  OFDI affects firms' income share. Specifically，the reverse technology
  spillover effect of OFDI promotes the innovation ability，R&D investment and
  total factor productivity for domestic companies so that the labor income
  share is increased. This mechanism is validated by mediation test. To
  conclude，this paper provides evidences based on micro - data regarding the
  relationships between OFDI and domestic labor income share and enriches the
  related literatures. Our findings also deliver useful implications for the
  policymakers to promote the labor income share: First，the government should
  continue to advance OFDI alongside“the Belt and Road” and implement the
  differential incentive policies in accordance with the characteristics of the
  enterprises. Second，the government should create an atmosphere of fair
  competition and encourage enterprises innovation and provide favorable
  guarantee for innovation. Third，the government should speed up the reform of
  income distribution and adopt supportive measures to promote opportunities in
  employment of workers，especially for low - skilled labors at basic grassroots
  level. Meanwhile，the enterprises should also put more emphasis on the on high
  - skilled labors in the development of enterprises，which may facilitate the
  development of macroeconomics and social harmony and stability."

summary: '文章基于2003-2016年中国上市公司数据,采用倾向得分匹配和双重差分法（PSMDID）探讨"一带一路"沿线对外直接投资与母国劳动收入份额之间的因果关系。实证发现,企业对外直接投资长期内整体上提高了职工的工资份额。考虑企业所处地区、行业和劳动者的异质性后,结论仍然稳健。具体而言,企业通过对外直接投资的逆向技术溢出提高了创新能力、研发投入和全要素生产率,从而提高了母国职工工资份额。此外,企业的技术进步具有高技能劳动力的偏向性,母国高技能劳动者的工资份额在企业对外直接投资中得以显著提升,但对于母国低技能劳动者的工资份额影响不显著。文章研究发现"一带一路"沿线对外直接投资对母国劳动收入份额的影响机制和具体效应提供了微观证据。
