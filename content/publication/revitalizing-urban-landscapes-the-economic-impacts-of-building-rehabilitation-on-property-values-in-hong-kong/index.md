  This paper examines the external and internal property value effects of
  building rehabil-

  itation projects in Hong Kong, a city renowned for its successful urban renewal model.

  Using housing transaction data and a Hedonic difference-in-difference model, the study

  uncovers a significant positive impact of building rehabilitations on the property values of

  nearby residences within a 300-m radius of the renovated buildings. Additionally, through

  a heterogeneity analysis, the research highlights variations in property value externalities

  according to the age of the buildings and the size of the flats. The findings reveal an 8.4%

  increase in property value for rehabilitated buildings, a result that is robustly validated

  through comprehensive testing. These results emphasize the cost-effectiveness of building

  rehabilitation as a tool for urban renewal and underscore the importance of prioritizing this

  approach to mitigate urban decay.
